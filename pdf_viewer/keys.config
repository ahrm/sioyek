# you can edit this file to change keybindings lines that start with '#' are comments
# the syntax is pretty simple. Some examples:
#command        k             (command is executed when k is pressed)
#command        <C-k>         (command is executed when k is pressed while holding control)
#command        K             (command is executed when K is entered, which is shift+k)
#command        <A-k>         (command is executed when k is pressed while holding alt)
#command        +             (command is executed when = is pressed while holding shift)
#command        <C-S-k>       (command is executed when k is pressed while holding control and shift)
#command        gg            (command is executed when g is pressed twice)
#command        gt            (command is executed when g is pressed and then t is pressed)
#command        g<C-n>Dt  (command is executed when g is pressed and then n is pressed while holding\
#                               control and then d is pressed while holding shift and then t is pressed)
# you can execute multiple commands using the following syntax:
#command1;command2;command3        <keybinding>
