# you can edit this file to change keybindings lines that start with '#' are comments
# the syntax is pretty simple. Some examples:
#command        k             (command is executed when k is pressed)
#command        <C-k>         (command is executed when k is pressed while holding control)
#command        <S-k>         (command is executed when k is pressed while holding shift)
#command        <A-k>         (command is executed when k is pressed while holding alt)
#command        <S-+>         (command is executed when = is pressed while holding shift.
#                                Note that <S-=> would not work because of a bug in the command system so
#                                when prefixing non-ascii keys with shift, you have to specify the shift
#                                modified key in addition to the shift modifier)
#command        <C-S-k>       (command is executed when k is pressed while holding control and shift)
#command        gg            (command is executed when g is pressed twice)
#command        gt            (command is executed when g is pressed and then t is pressed)
#command        g<C-n><S-d>t  (command is executed when g is pressed and then n is pressed while holding\
#                               control and then d is pressed while holding shift and then t is pressed)

# ---------- SEARCH ----------

# search the document. 
# example: /something                   (searches the document for 'something')
# you can also specify a page range to search:
# example: /<110,135>something          (searches pages 110 to 135 (inclusive) for 'something')
search              <C-f>
search              /

# this is the same as search.
ranged_search       r<C-f>

# searches the current chapter. This is essentially the same as search but the range prefix is autofilled
# with the range of the current lowest level subchapter.
chapter_search      c<C-f>
chapter_search      c/

# Goto the next search item. Can be prefixed with a number which is the same as performing the command n times
# for example if we are on the 10th search result and we input 15n, we go to the 25th search result.

# Goto the previous search result. Can be prefixed with a number with similar rules as next_item.

# ---------- MARKS ----------

# Mark the current location. After pressing the mark button, you must enter a symbol (a letter from a-z or A-Z).
# this marks the current location in the file with the entered symbol. Afterwards you will be able to return to
# the locations of the marks using goto_mark command.
# example:  mm      (marks the current location in the file with a mark named 'm')
set_mark            m
# Goto a previously set mark. After pressing goto_mark you must enter a symbol associated with a previously set mark.
# example:  `m      (goes to the location of the mark named m)
goto_mark           `


# ---------- PORTALS ----------
